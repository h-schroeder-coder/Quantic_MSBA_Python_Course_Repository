for i in range(1, 9, 2):

#range (1, 9, 2) generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) 9, with a step of 2.
# This means it will generate the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7.
# The first argument is the starting number, the second argument is the stopping number (exclusive), and the third argument is the step size.
# the step size is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 1.
# The range function is commonly used in for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
# there is also a short form of the range function, which is range(n), where n is the stopping number (exclusive).
# In this case, it will generate numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) n, with a step of 1.
