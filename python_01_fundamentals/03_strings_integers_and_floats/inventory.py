item1 = "Earbuds"
status = " are in stock."
report = item1 + status

# in lines 1-2, the variable "item1" is assigned the string "Earbuds", and the variable "status" is assigned the string " are in stock.".
# In line 3, the variable "report" is assigned the concatenation of the strings in "item1" and "status", which results in the string "Earbuds are in stock.".
# In line 4, the print() function is used to display the value of the variable "report" on the screen.

item2 = "floppy disks"
print("Sorry, " + item2 + " are no longer available.")

# In line 1, the variable "item2" is assigned the string "floppy disks".
# In line 2, the print() function is used to display the string "Sorry, floppy disks are no longer available." on the screen.
# In this case, the string "floppy disks" is concatenated with the string "Sorry, " and the string " are no longer available." to form a complete sentence.
# The print() function is used to display the final string on the screen.
