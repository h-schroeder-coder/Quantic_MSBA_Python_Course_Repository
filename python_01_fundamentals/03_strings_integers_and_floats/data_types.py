num1 = 7
num2 = 12
total = num1 + num2
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", total)
# In this code, the variable "num1" is assigned the value 7, and the variable "num2" is assigned the value 12.
# The variable "total" is assigned the sum of "num1" and "num2", which is 19.
# The print() function is used to display the string "The sum of", followed by the values of "num1" and "num2", and finally the value of "total" on the screen.

print(total)
# In this code, the variable "total" is printed again, which will display the value 19 on the screen.
# Remember, to run the code, press shift + enter or click the run button in the toolbar.


temp = 75
# In this code, the variable "temp" is assigned the value 75.
# The variable "temp" is used to store the temperature value, which can be changed at any time by assigning a new value to it.

print("Today's high: " + str(temp))

# The print() function is used to display the string "Today's high: " followed by the value of "temp" on the screen.
# The value of "temp" is converted to a string using the str() function, so that it can be concatenated with the string "Today's high: ".

print("Today's high:", temp)
# In this code, the print() function is used to display the string "Today's high:" followed by the value of "temp" on the screen.
# The value of "temp" is not converted to a string, so it will be displayed as a number.

var1 = "a"
var2 = "7"
var3 = 5
var4 = 3.6
# In this code, the variables "var1", "var2", "var3", and "var4" are assigned different values.
# The variable "var1" is assigned the string "a", the variable "var2" is assigned the string "7", the variable "var3" is assigned the integer 5, and the variable "var4" is assigned the float 3.6.

# after running the code, the variables will be:
# var1 = "a"   
# var2 = "7"
# var3 = 5
# var4 = 3.6

# you can use the type() function to check the data type of a variable.
# this can be done in the script or in the Python shell.

# if you run the code in the script, you will see the output in the console.
print(type(var1))  # <class 'str'>

# if you run the code, type(var2), in the Python shell, you will see the output, <class 'str'>, in the shell.

# other useful functions are int() and float().
# the int() function converts a string or float to an integer.
# the float() function converts a string or integer to a float.
# for example, if you have a string "7" and you want to convert it to an integer, you can use the int() function:
