# print a customer's food order.

food = "burritos"
print(food)


# In this code, the word "food" is a variable, a label for storing changeable information, that stores the string "burritos".
# The equals sign (=), the assignment operator, is used to assign the value "burritos" to the variable "food".
# If the value being assigned to the variable is a string (i.e., text), it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
# If the value is a number (i.e., 3), it does not need to be enclosed in quotation marks.
# The print() function is used to display the value of the variable "food" on the screen.
# The value of a variable can be changed at any time by assigning a new value to it.
# For example, if we want to change the value of "food" to "tacos", we can do so by reassigning it:

food = "tacos"
print(food)

# variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# They cannot start with a number or contain spaces or special characters.
# They are case-sensitive, meaning that "food" and "Food" are considered different variables.
# Variable names should be short, descriptive, and meaningful, so that anyone reading the code can understand what the variable represents.
# Avoid abbreviations or acronyms that are not commonly known, as they can make the code harder to read and understand.
# It is a good practice to use descriptive variable names that indicate what the variable represents.
# It is also a good practice to use lowercase letters for variable names and separate words with underscores.
# For example, instead of using "food", we could use "customer_order" to make it clear that this variable represents a customer's food order.
# They can't be a Python function or keyword, such as print, if, or else.


# Display order.
food = "burrito"
filling = "cheese"

print("Customer's order:")
print(filling)  
print(food)
